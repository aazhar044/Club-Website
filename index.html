The  speciality of this club is that can any one from any course and branch will join the the club and explore their knowledge to others. Nowadays it is very essential to have the knowledge of computers and their languages and in TechPro club I learnt python language very easily. The advantages which I get as the member of TechPro,  that if there is any event/test/activity by the club,I get these all at lower fee compare to the non- TechPro students.Even I get some of these events free of cost . Nowadays B.Tech degree is not enough to get the desired job , you should have extra skills in Technical field and certification of those skills. So I join Techpro club .In TechPro club I get many great Ideas of Computer Science and learned some amazing tricks which I can't learned from Google.I feel really good being a member of TechPro club and I advised all the students of Quantum University to registered themselves in TechPro club .</p>

                   <p>Hello,My name is Anushka Verma. I have been attending the TechPro club since one year. I could say proudly that it is one the best and one of my favorite club since one year. I have learned and experienced a lot of things through this club. Under the guidance of my inimitable seniors, I learned python, I learned C++, I came to overview the magic of computer science engineering.

                   Those superb classes taken by our seniors, learning through video tutorials, testing our knowledge through tests and competitions with different students, have made me more confident about the knowledge in the field of computer science engineering. I have gained a lot of confidence through this journey. It increases my curiosity for computer science more and more every day. It is helping me each and every day to grow my knowledge and skills in professional area. It is not only about our curriculum but it also involves those extra and essential knowledge which is building a professionalism in me and clearing my way to make  a marvelous future.</p>

                   <p>Hi I’m Amrisha Bhardwaj. I am personally convinced that TechPro club has been proved very beneficial to me. I came to know the outlook of computer science department. I tried learning Front End and Back End, all with the help of internet, and video lectures but I actually came to know about it when my seniors discussed about the same from scratch. It is really a very interactive club where the students are the learners as well as mentor. It also helps you to develop confidence and a sense of learning in us.

                  Here all the members of TechProb are passionate to teach and learn respectively. And I am also one of the students of TechPro club and I learnt many things related to my scope and got many knowledges. The name techpro is clarify that here we get theoretical as well as practical knowledge and also make us awre of the current trend of the technology.

                  Our seniors are always ready to suffice our curiosity. We will learn something other than what your books teach us, and will surely develop skills that will help us to be prolific in your profession.</p>
